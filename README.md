## Heading ##

We are building a social media app which targets the youth. Users can post whatever is on their mind (no community guidelines). Users are also allowed to like and comment on posts. 

## Sub-Heading ##

This app is for anyone, and is a way to interact with users by sharing what is on their mind.

## Summary ##
Not Twitter is a social media account that allows you to post whatever you want to the world. You can log in and make these posts and see other users' posts ordered by when they were made. A user can like and comment on another user's post. You can also see other people who have liked and commented on a post. Not twitter allows you to connect with people from anywhere virtually.

## Problem ##

This app solves the problem of self-expression. Not Twitter will allow uses to express themselves and share their thoughts. If anyone 13 and older wants to have a place to rant/vent/share their opinions as long as it's respectful, Not Twitter is the app to use.

## Solution ##

This app allows users to post comments, like posts and be apart of a community. If you share the same opinion as someone else, just like their post. If you want to respond with your own thoughts, then just comment on their post. It's all about building a community.

## Key Technical Challenge ##

Authenthicating the users will likely be the most challenging technical hurdle.

## Extension Opportunities ##

Adding a followers feature will be something that we would like to add with extended time (if we're not able to).
